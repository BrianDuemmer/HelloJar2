CHANGES
=======

V 2.2.5
- Improved the linux script used for starting the BluetoothServer.
- The About dialog now prints System info with OS name, architecture, version and Java version.
- If you try to start the Server in Mac OS X you will get a warning window at startup, 
  saying that we do not support this operating system. You will be able to start.
- Added the startup script for Mac OS X.

V 2.2.4
- Improved the BluetoothAppender to not throw a NPE when executing on emulator.

V 2.2.3
- Improved the Bluetooth server shell script for Linux.

v 2.2.2
- Fixed Bug ID: 2907066.

v 2.2.1
- Fixed build problems in Maven.

v 2.2.0

- Added tests for the BluetoothAppender and its helper classes.
- Removed problem with setting the lineseparator in the FileAppender class.
- Supports the microlog.appender.BluetoothSerialAppender.btAddress property for setting the server Bluetooth address. This has the added benefit of simpler client code. Also, backwards compatibility is great since all that needs to be changed is adding the property value and it will use the new service search method instead of the unreliable selectService method previously used.
- Added a window that will show the server Bluetooth address in the Bluetooth UI.
- A new class containing all the Bluetooth communication code is added (BluetoothConnectionHandler) that will help keep the appender much cleaner.

v 2.1.0
- Added the possibility to add custom aliases for appenders and formatters.
